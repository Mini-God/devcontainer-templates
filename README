# Dev Container Templates by johnluicn

This repo is based on the [Dev Container Template Starter](https://github.com/devcontainers/template-starter) and the [Dev Container Template specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/templates-distribution/#distribution).

This repository contains a set of **Dev Container Templates** which are source files packaged together that encode configuration for a complete development environment. A Template can be used in a new or existing project, and a [supporting tool](https://containers.dev/supporting) will use the configuration from the template to build a development container.

## Contents

- [`src`](src) - A collection of subfolders, each declaring a template. Each subfolder contains at least a
    `devcontainer-template.json` and a [devcontainer.json](https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/).
- [`test`](test) - Mirroring `src`, a folder-per-template with at least a `test.sh` script. These tests are executed by the [CI](https://github.com/johnluicn/devcontainer-templates/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-pr.yaml).

## Contributions

### Creating your own collection of templates

The [Dev Container Template specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/templates-distribution/#distribution) outlines a pattern for community members and organizations to self-author Templates in repositories they control.

A starter repository [devcontainers/template-starter](https://github.com/devcontainers/template-starter) and [GitHub Action](https://github.com/devcontainers/action) are available to help bootstrap self-authored Templates.

### Contributing to this repository

This repository will accept improvement and bug fix contributions related to the
[current set of maintained templates](./src).

## Feedback
